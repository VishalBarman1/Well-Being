# Well-Being
Well-Being- an outright geriatric destination (Idea Submission for KardiaChain Pioneer Program 2.0)

**Team Name:** Virtual Lee

**Team Member**: Vishal Barman

**Theme:** Social Goods and Community Engagement Projects

**Objective:** To design and devise an outright destination interface for geriatric care to provide outright assistance towards the elderly and differently abled people encompassing each and every basic requirement and fulfill their needs to the maximal extent, leveraging Kardiachain ecosystem.

**Implementation:**

* For Elderly People suffering from Alzheimer's Disease or Dementia, the system incorporates Facial Recognition to identify important faces in Video calls, online conferences or existing photos in the database or server. Computer vision for analyzing contents in images and videos that is for fall detection monitoring and medical report and prescription OCR generation. OpenCV's Caffe model of the DNN module is a choice for the purpose as it works well with occlusion, quick head movements, and can identify side faces as well and deployed as a Dapp.

* Along with that, daily scheduling of tasks and medicines, buying of medicines and doctor's appointment will be available with a simplified Modular UI design friendly for the elderly. Kardiachain will be implemented for the transactional purposes through its Wallet extension.

* People suffering from Parkinson's Disease are also assisted with early detection of the neural disorder with gait recognition feature leveraging Gradient Boosting Algorithm and provision for efficient treatment of the same. 

* Another important feature includes fall detection monitoring through gesture recognition which leads to most internal damage or even further deaths of the elderly and immediate care is required. 

* Each helper associated with elderly can be connected through the Dapp in the Kardiachain ecosystem, where necessary updates might be received even in dire situations like the lockdown. Financial Assistance through fraud detection in credit card and other scams and to assist in deciding best retirement plans. 

* Retrieval Based Chatbot with NLP processing with contextual embeddings for friendly interaction in order to tackle loneliness resisting the chances of depression or providing measures for him to interact with a professional in case the person is suffering from depression.

* The app will also be able cater to the conferencing needs of old people to interact with their near and dear ones or even with other older people for enhanced interaction.

* It will also be able to connect the volunteers to provide manual assistance to the elderly people whenever required for a provided incentive in the blockchain.
